# Restricted-Boltzmann-Machine-(RBM)

It is a implemetation of Restricted-Boltzmann-Machine in Tensorflow.

Restricted-Boltzmann-Machine (RBM) are a generative stochastic artificial neural network cosisting of two-layer neural nets that are the building blocks of deep-belief networks. 

The feature obtaied after training o MNIST data after 20000 iteration with batch size of 10.
